##

> Of all personality types, [conscientious people]{.yellow} tend to fare best on a number of key measures. They [live the longest]{.yellow}, have the [most career success]{.yellow} and are [less likely to go through divorce]{.yellow}. They even manage to hold down a job during recessions. Intuitively, this makes sense. Life isnâ€™t just about knowing what you should do, or having the resources to do it, [itâ€™s about following through]{.yellow}. Being motivated and persistent is a huge help.

## Conclusion


> Conscientiousness will separate those who just survive from those who thrive in the 21st century. We can each decide which half of that divide we fall on â€” but ironically that will take some dedication.
